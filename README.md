# Worldwide Autism Burden

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) represents a significant global health concern with profound implications for individuals, families, and societies at large. Worldwide, the prevalence of autism has seen a steady increase over the past few decades, leading many researchers and health professionals to describe it as an "epidemic". According to a report by the World Health Organization, it is estimated that one in 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder. However, this rate can vary significantly across different countries and regions. For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in 2020 that one in 54 children in the United States has been identified with ASD. The reasons for these increasing numbers remain a subject of debate, encompassing potential factors like better diagnostic tools, broader diagnostic criteria, heightened awareness, or a genuine rise in incidence. Regardless of the cause, this rising prevalence underscores the urgency to allocate resources, formulate effective interventions, and ensure inclusive practices to address the diverse needs of this population.

# Metrics

 ### Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)

**Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)** is a measure used in public health to quantify the overall burden of disease. It combines the years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL) and the years lived with disability (YLD) for a particular disease or injury. In essence, one DALY represents one lost year of "healthy" life.

### Prevalence

**Prevalence** refers to the proportion of individuals in a population who have a specific characteristic, condition, or disease at a particular point in time or over a specified time period. In epidemiology and public health, prevalence is commonly used to describe the extent of a health-related issue within a population.

**Period prevalence:** This measures the proportion of individuals in a population who have a condition or characteristic at any time during a specified time period, such as a year. It accounts for all new and existing cases during that time frame. Using the flu example again, if you wanted to know how many people in the same city had the flu at any point during the entirety of 2022 and found that 10,000 did, the period prevalence for that year would be 10%.

Prevalence is distinct from incidence. While prevalence measures the overall proportion of cases in a population during a specific time frame, incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease or condition that develop in a population during a specific time period.

In research and public health, understanding the prevalence of a disease or condition helps policymakers and health professionals assess the overall burden of that disease in the community and allocate resources appropriately.

### Incidence

**Incidence** is a measure used in epidemiology to describe the occurrence of new cases of a disease or condition in a population over a specific period of time. It provides insight into the risk or probability of developing the disease within that timeframe.

**Cumulative Incidence (or Incidence Proportion):** This measures the number of new cases of a disease in a population at risk during a specified time period, divided by the number of individuals at risk of developing the disease at the beginning of the time period. It essentially answers the question, "Out of the people at risk, what proportion will get the disease over this time period?" It's often expressed as a percentage.

Incidence is distinct from prevalence. While incidence concerns new cases of a disease over a time period, prevalence captures the proportion of a population that has the disease at a specific point in time or over a given time span. Incidence offers insights into the risk of developing a disease, whereas prevalence indicates how widespread a disease is in a population. Both measures are crucial for understanding disease patterns and for guiding public health interventions and policy.
